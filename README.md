# Description

This program first processes the available images, identifying the objects and capturing the actions being performed (captions), and then stores this information in the database. When interacting with our chatbot, we have the flexibility to specify our preferences and the desired actions for the images. The bot takes care of the rest, seamlessly executing our requests.
